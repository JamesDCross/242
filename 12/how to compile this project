cat p.c - prints the c file out in the terminal

gcc *.c - compiles all c files in a folder

note you cannot compile them seperately, you have to compile all the c files.

you dont actually need to make the o files and join things together into one like in the second test

echo *.c - finds all c files in the folder

gcc htable.c mylib.c p.c -o test note: he has compiled all c and outputted to the same file
